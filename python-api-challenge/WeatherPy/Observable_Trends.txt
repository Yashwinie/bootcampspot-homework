Trend 1: There is a clear coorelation between proximity to the equator and the maximum temperature a city experiences. This analysis provides a definitive answer to the research question, namely that the maximum temperature of a city appears to be warmer the closer that city lies to the equator.

Trend 2: There does not appear to be correlation betweem proximity to the equator and the three other factors analysed (i.e. latitude vs humidity, latitude vs cloudiness, and latitude vs wind speed). Therefore, with just these variables, it appears that temperature is the only variable analysed that is impacted by region's proximity to the equator. Wind speed, cloudiness, and humidity do not appear to become less or greater the closer or further away a city lies from the equator.

Trend 3: The plot is relatively evenly-spaced between latitude and humidity, and latitude and cloudiness. However, there is significant clumping and a number of outliers in the analysis between latitude and wind speed. It would worth examining the wind speed anlaysis further (i.e. by altering the y-axis, and looking at other variables that could impact wind speed like the geographies of cities).
